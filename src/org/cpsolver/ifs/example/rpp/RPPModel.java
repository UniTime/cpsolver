/**
 * RPP model. <br>
 * <br>
 * The random placement problem (RPP; for more details, see <a href=
 * 'http://www.fi.muni.cz/~hanka/rpp/'>http://www.fi.muni.cz/~hanka/rpp/</a>)
 * seeks to place a set of randomly generated rectangles (called objects) of
 * different sizes into a larger rectangle (called placement area) in such a way
 * that no objects overlap and all objects' borders are parallel to the border
 * of the placement area. In addition, a set of allowable placements can be
 * randomly generated for each object. The ratio between the total area of all
 * objects and the size of the placement area will be denoted as the filled area
 * ratio. <br>
 * <br>
 * RPP allows us to generate various instances of the problem similar to a
 * trivial timetabling problem. The correspondence is as follows: the object
 * corresponds to a course to be timetabled - the x-coordinate to its time, the
 * y-coordinate to its classroom. For example, a course taking three hours
 * corresponds to an object with dimensions 3x1 (the course should be taught in
 * one classroom only). Each course can be placed only in a classroom of
 * sufficient capacity - we can expect that the classrooms are ordered
 * increasingly in their size so each object will have a lower bound on its
 * y-coordinate.
