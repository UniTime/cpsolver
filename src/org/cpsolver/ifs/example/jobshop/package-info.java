/**
 * JobShop Problem.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * The Job-shop scheduling problem (n,m,J,Cmax) is concerned with
 * ordering n jobs on m machines: each job is composed of an ordered list
 * of m operations and must be processed during a uninterrupted time
 * period of a given length on each of the m machines. The objective is
 * to minimise the makespan, i.e., the maximum of job completion times.
