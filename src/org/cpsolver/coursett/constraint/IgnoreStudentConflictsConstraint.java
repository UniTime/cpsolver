/**
 * Ignore student conflicts constraint. <br>
 * This constraint keeps track of classes between which student conflicts of any kind are to be ignored.
 * This constraint is used by {@link Lecture#isToIgnoreStudentConflictsWith(Lecture)} and translates to
 * {@link StudentConflict#ignore(Lecture, Lecture)} that is true when the two classes are connected by
 * this constraint.
