		University Course Timetabling: Heuristics.

		The quality of a solution is expressed as a weighted sum combining
		soft time and classroom preferences, satisfied soft group constrains
		and the total number of student conflicts. This allows us to express
		the importance of different types of soft constraints. The following
		weights are considered in the sum:
		<ul>
			<li>
				weight of a student conflict,
				<li>
					weight of a time preference of a placement,
					<li>
						weight of a classroom preference of a placement,
						<li>
							weight of a preference of a satisfied soft group constraint,
							<li>
								weight of a distance instructor preference of a placement (it is
								discouraged if there are two subsequent classes taught by the
								same instructor but placed in different buildings not far than
								50 meters, strongly discouraged if the buildings are more than
								50 meters but less than 200 meters far)
								<li>
									weight of the overall department balancing penalty (number of
									the time units used over initial allowances summed over all
									times and departments)
									<li>
										weight of an useless half-hour (empty half-hour time segments
										between classes, such half-hours cannot be used since all
										events require at least one hour)
										<li>
											weight of a too large classrooms (weight for each classroom
											that has more than 50% excess seats)
		</ul>
		<br>
		Note that preferences of all time, classroom and group soft
		constraints go from -2 (strongly preferred) to 2 (strongly
		discouraged). So, for instance, the value of the weighted sum is
		increased when there is a discouraged time or room selected or a
		discouraged group constraint satisfied. Therefore, if there are two
		solutions, the better solution of them has the lower weighted sum of
		the above criteria.
		<br>
		<br>
		The termination condition stops the search when the solution is
		complete and good enough (expressed as the number of perturbations and
		the solution quality described above). It also allows for the solver
		to be stopped by the user. Characteristics of the current and the best
		achieved solution, describing the number of assigned variables, time
		and classroom preferences, the total number of student conflicts,
		etc., are visible to the user during the search.
		<br>
		<br>
		The solution comparator prefers a more complete solution (with a
		smaller number of unassigned variables) and a solution with a smaller
		number of perturbations among solutions with the same number of
		unassigned variables. If both solutions have the same number of
		unassigned variables and perturbations, the solution of better quality
		is selected.
		<br>
		<br>
		If there are one or more variables unassigned, the variable selection
		criterion picks one of them randomly. We have tried several approaches
		using domain sizes, number of previous assignments, numbers of
		constraints in which the variable participates, etc., but there was no
		significant improvement in this timetabling problem towards the random
		selection of an unassigned variable. The reason is, that it is easy to
		go back when a wrong variable is picked - such a variable is
		unassigned when there is a conflict with it in some of the subsequent
		iterations.
		<br>
		<br>
		When all variables are assigned, an evaluation is made for each
		variable according to the above described weights. The variable with
		the worst evaluation is selected. This variable promises the best
		improvement in optimization.
		<br>
		<br>
		We have implemented a hierarchical handling of the value selection
		criteria. There are three levels of comparison. At each level a
		weighted sum of the criteria described below is computed. Only
		solutions with the smallest sum are considered in the next level. The
		weights express how quickly a complete solution should be found. Only
		hard constraints are satisfied in the first level sum. Distance from
		the initial solution (MPP), and a weighting of major preferences
		(including time, classroom requirements and student conflicts), are
		considered in the next level. In the third level, other minor criteria
		are considered. In general, a criterion can be used in more than one
		level, e.g., with different weights.
		<br>
		<br>
		The above sums order the values lexicographically: the best value
		having the smallest first level sum, the smallest second level sum
		among values with the smallest first level sum, and the smallest third
		level sum among these values. As mentioned above, this allows
		diversification between the importance of individual criteria.
		<br>
		<br>
		Furthermore, the value selection heuristics also support some limits
		(e.g., that all values with a first level sum smaller than a given
		percentage Pth above the best value [typically 10%] will go to the
		second level comparison and so on). This allows for the continued
		feasibility of a value near to the best that may yet be much better in
		the next level of comparison. If there is more than one solution after
		these three levels of comparison, one is selected randomly. This
		approach helped us to significantly improve the quality of the
		resultant solutions.
		<br>
		<br>
		In general, there can be more than three levels of these weighted
		sums, however three of them seem to be sufficient for spreading
		weights of various criteria for our problem.
		<br>
		<br>
		The value selection heuristics also allow for random selection of a
		value with a given probability (random walk, e.g., 2%) and, in the
		case of MPP, to select the initial value (if it exists) with a given
		probability (e.g., 70%).
		<br>
		<br>
		Criteria used in the value selection heuristics can be divided into
		two sets. Criteria in the first set are intended to generate a
		complete assignment:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Number of hard conflicts
				<li>
					Number of hard conflicts, weighted by their previous occurrences
					(see conflict-based statistics)
		</ul>
		Additional criteria allow better results to be achieved during
		optimization:
		<ul>
			<li>
				Number of student conflicts caused by the value if it is assigned to
				the variable
				<li>
					Soft time preference caused by a value if it is assigned to the
					variable
					<li>
						Soft classroom preference caused by a value if it is assigned to
						the variable (combination of the placement's building, room, and
						classroom equipment compared with preferences)
						<li>
							Preferences of satisfied soft group constraints caused by the
							value if it is assigned to the variable
							<li>
								Difference in the number of assigned initial values if the value
								is assigned to the variable: -1 if the value is initial, 0
								otherwise, increased by the number of initial values assigned to
								variables with hard conflicts with the value.
								<li>
									Distance instructor preference caused by a value if it is
									assigned to the variable (together with the neighbour classes)
									<li>
										Difference in department balancing penalty
										<li>
											Difference in the number of useless half-hours (number of
											empty half-hour time segments between classes that arise,
											minus those which disappear if the value is selected)
											<li>
												Classroom is too big: 1 if the selected classroom has more
												than 50% excess seats
		</ul>
		<br>
		Let us emphasize that the criteria from the second group are needed
		for optimization only, i.e., they are not needed to find a feasible
		solution. Furthermore, assigning a different weight to a particular
		criteria influences the value of the corresponding objective function.
