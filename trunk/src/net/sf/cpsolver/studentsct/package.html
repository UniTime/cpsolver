<h1>Student Sectioning Solver.</h1>
<br><br>
Student sectioning is often considered as a subproblem of
course timetabling. Once a timetable has been developed,
the object is to assign students to classes (i.e., individual
sections of a course) in order to minimize conflicts while respecting
individual student course requests and preferences
along with various other constraints.
<br><br>
Before and during the construction of the timetable course
demands are collected from students. During this preregistration
process, each student can indicate the list of requested
courses together with his or her preferences. 
These preferences contain course priorities (order
of courses based on their importance for the student), alternative
course requests (each course request can have one or
more alternative courses), free time requests, wait-list preferences
(if a student cannot be enrolled into the course, e.g.,
because of the space available, should he or she be assigned
to the appropriate wait-list for the course), and additional
schedule distribution preferences.
<br><br>
<h2>Initial Sectioning</h2>
During the construction of the course
timetable, course demands of already pre-registered students
are considered. Since many students are anticipated to register
later in the process, projected course demands are considered
as well. These are deducted from the last-like semester
enrollments, e.g., Fall 2006 course enrollments are used to
predict Fall 2007 course demands. Minimization of potential
student conflicts is one of the optimization criteria of
the timetabling solver. Two classes are conflicting, i.e., they
cannot be attended by the same students, if they are overlapping
in time or if they are back-to-back (the second class
starts just after the first ends) being placed in rooms that are
too far apart.
<br>
Before the course timetabling solver is started, an initial
sectioning of students into classes is processed. This sectioning
is based on Carters (Carter 2001) homogeneous sectioning
and is intended to minimize future student conflicts.
However, it is still possible to improve on the number of student
conflicts in the solution. This is accomplished by moving students 
between alternative classes of the same course
during or after the search for a timetabling solution.
<br><br>
<h2>Batch Sectioning</h2>
After the course timetable for the whole
university is constructed, batch student sectioning process
is executed. In this process, all pre-registered students are
assigned to specific sections (classes) of courses in order
to minimize conflicts as well as optimize preferences provided
by students. Additional constraints deducted from the
course structure as well as various reservations, that can be
put on courses or particular classes, are respected. Students
that were not able to get a requested course (or any of the
provided alternatives) are enrolled to the appropriate waitlists.
<br>
The batch student sectioning is also using the projected
student demands to compute the expected number of students
in each class for the following online phase, however,
pre-registered students take precedence before projected student
demands. This means that a pre-registered student cannot
be bumped out a requested course because of a projected
student, but he or she may end up with a class which does
not prevent projected students to take the course as well.
Based on the computed solution, pre-registered students are
assigned to classes and wait-lists and the projected students
demands are used to identify space in each section that is
to be reserved for students that are not yet registered. This
information is then used in the online sectioning phase in
order to direct already registered students from sections that
are expected to be taken by the future students.
<br><br>
<h2>Online Sectioning</h2>
After the first student schedule is created,
till the begining of the semester, students can make
changes in their schedules using the online interface. During
this phase, existing students are allowed to remove themself
from the requested courses or request additional courses
and a new sectioning solution is provided to them in realtime.
They can also change their class enrollments if there
are other classes of the course that are available or wait-list
themselves on classes that are not available. Wait-lists are
automatically processed as the space frees on courses and
classes. Some changes in the course timetable might occur
as well, potentiality causing some re-sectioning of existing
students. New students are using the same interface as existing
students. They start with the course demands first, based
on which they are sectioned to courses in real-time, and then
they can continue as existing students.
<br>
As students submit schedule requests, each course is
ranked in priority order. During realtime sectioning of a student,
the search employs a backtracking process considering
possible assignments beginning with those classes associated
with the students highest priority course. As it evaluates
each possible assignment, it compares available space
with the space expected to be taken by the future students
for each class. This difference between available space and
the expected need for each class is used to direct students
away from class assignments that would result in excess demand,
however, in no case is an eligible student blocked
from scheduling a course offering as a result of expected
future demand. As students are assigned to specific classes
during the sectioning process, the expected demand for each
class is adjusted to reflect the assignment.
