		Simple Timetabling Problem.
		<br>
		<br>
		Simplified model for timetabling problems consisting of a set of
		resources, a set of activities, and a set of dependencies between the
		activities. Time is divided into time slots with the same duration.
		Every slot may have assigned a constraint, either hard or soft: a hard
		constraint indicates that the slot is forbidden for any activity, a
		soft constraint indicates that the slot is not preferred. We call
		these constraints “time preferences”. Every activity and every
		resource may have assigned a set of time preferences, which indicate
		forbidden and not preferred time slots.
		<br>
		<br>
		Activity (which can be, for instance, directly mapped to a lecture) is
		identified by its name. Every activity is described by its duration
		(expressed as a number of time slots), by time preferences, and by a
		set of resources. This set of resources determines which resources are
		required by the activity. To model alternative as well as required
		resources, we divide the set of resources into several subsets –
		resource groups. Each group is either conjunctive or disjunctive: the
		conjunctive group of resources means that the activity needs all the
		resources from the group, the disjunctive group means that the
		activity needs exactly one of the resources (we can choose from
		several alternatives). An example can be a lecture, which will take
		place in one of the possible classrooms and it will be taught for all
		of the selected classes. Note that we do not need to model conjunctive
		groups explicitly because we can use a set of disjunctive groups
		containing exactly one resource instead (the set of required resources
		can be described in a conjunctive normal form). However, usage of both
		conjunctive and disjunctive groups simplifies modelling for the users.
		<br>
		<br>
		Resource is also identified by its name and it is fully described by
		time preferences. There is a hard condition that only one activity can
		use the resource at the same time. For instance, such resource can
		represent a teacher, a class, a classroom, or another special resource
		at the lecture timetabling problem.
		<br>
		<br>
		Finally, we need a mechanism for defining and handling direct
		dependencies between the activities. It seems sufficient to use binary
		dependencies only that define relationship between two activities. We
		defined three temporal constraints: the activity finishes before
		another activity, the activity finishes exactly at the time when the
		second activity starts, and two activities run concurrently (they have
		the same start time).
		<br>
		<br>
		The solution of the problem defined by the above model is a timetable
		where every scheduled activity has assigned its start time and a set
		of reserved resources that are needed for its execution (the activity
		is allocated to respective slots of the reserved resources). This
		timetable must satisfy all the hard constraints, namely:
		<ul>
			<li>
				every scheduled activity has all the required resources reserved,
				i.e., all resources from the conjunctive groups and one resource
				from each disjunctive group of resources,
				<li>
					two scheduled activities cannot use the same resource at the same
					time,
					<li>
						no activity is scheduled into a time slot where the activity or
						some of its reserved resources has a hard constraint in the time
						preferences,
						<li>
							all dependencies between the scheduled activities must be
							satisfied.
		</ul>
		Furthermore, we want to minimize the number of violated soft
		constraints in the time preferences of resources and activities. We do
		not formally express this objective function; these preferences will
		be used as a guide during the search for the solution.
